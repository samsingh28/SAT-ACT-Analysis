Project 1: SAT and ACT Score Analysis

1.This project comprised of two different data sets. One data set contained ACT scores for 2017 and 2018 and the other data set contained SAT scores of the same time line. The data sets were chronologically ordered and hence did not require any reordering. Some data for the SAT scores had to be manually imported in the form of a dataset in the notebook and was contained within the corrosponding folder with a path available. The data sets were then cleaned through assigning appropriate data types and correct values within the columns to fit the sata types and streamline the data set.

After cleaning the data set, statistical operations such as averages and standard deviation were applied as a form of Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA). EDA is used to identify any trends and highlight any correaltions that might exist in the data sets. EDA helps in explaining the data in a way that might not be visible to the naked eye. In this case multiple findings were established by performing EDA.

In the final step, the findings from the EDA were visualized through plotting visual aides auch as histograms and scatter plots. Visualizing helps in presenting the data in a form that is more palatable to non-technical audience. Visualizing also helps in presenting data in a neat and organized form so the user can derive certain observations just through the visual

The findings of the analysis are as follows:

i. ACT participation is higher than SAT.

ii. As participation increases, scores descrease. (negative correlation)

iii. More test prep can help students improving scores.

iv. SAT vs ACT scores are influenced by local socioeconomic and political climates.

v. There is need for more micro/granular data to make further recommendations which can be more specific in nature.
